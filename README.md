# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting algorithms are algorithms used to arrange a collection of elements in a specific order. They play a fundamental role in computer science and are used in various applications. The efficiency of sorting algorithms is commonly analyzed using Big O notation, which describes the algorithm's time complexity and space complexity.
